# DifferentialExpression_Tuturial
Within this Github repository is an RNASeq workflow using STAR, HTSeq, DESeq2, GSEA, and Morpheus (Broad Institute). Everything you need for running DESeq2, running GSEA, and making heatmaps is in this folder (although you will need to download GSEA to your computer and download R libaries to R)
